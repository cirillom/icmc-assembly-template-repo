# Template project for the ICMC Processor Simulator with the preprocessor (Linux)

### Dependencies
The only dependency you need is the simulator itself, in order to install it just type ``` make simulator ``` and everything will be done for you.

### Usage
**Don't change _bootstrapper.asm_**
You can create any _.asm_ and _.vars_ files under _src/_, however at the moment you cannot work with subdirectories.

##### Future improvements
- [ ] Remove charmap from _res/_ and use the one from [ICMC-assembly-preprocessor](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/ICMC-assembly-preprocessor) submodule.
